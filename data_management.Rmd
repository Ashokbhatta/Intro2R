```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data Set

- We'll use a derivitive of the `mtcars` dataset.  
- Use the `?mtcars` to get the codebook.

## Load Data

RStudio has an on-board data loading wizard which uses the `readr()` package for data loading.  
See Menubar `File > Import Dataset`

> ![RStudio Environment Pane](images/import_data.png "Environment Pane")

&nbsp;

```{r get data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# readr::read_csv
# 'read_csv()' is part of the 'readr' package and will override the base-R default of converting characters as factors.  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/README.html

cars <- read_csv("data/cars.csv")
```

## View your data in a grid

```{r}
View(cars)
# Displays as a tab in the source-pane quadrant
# Does not dipsplay in an R Notebooks
```

### Other Data Loaders, a selective list

- `View()` is an exploratory convenience; it's not "reproducible" in the sense of generating a report or leaving a trail of your work.  One of the advantages is on-board clickable sorting

- Environment Pane has information about data objects


## Modern Data Frames: Tibbles

* "Table as data frame"", a modern tidyverse table
```{r Table-dataframe}
cars 
```

&nbsp;

## Data Structure

### Class

```{r}
class(cars)
```

&nbsp;

### Glimpse into a data frame

```{r}
glimpse(cars)
```

&nbsp;

### Older style 

`str()` works on all data structures:  data frames, matricies, lists, etc.

```{r}
str(cars)
```

&nbsp;

### Useful Command

`tbl_vars` lists table variables (column headers) as a vector

```{r variables}
tbl_vars(cars)
```
