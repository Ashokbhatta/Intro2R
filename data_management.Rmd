The [Tidyverse](https://tidyveres.org) is a set of packages that work together within a common tidy-data framework.^[https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/]  These packages modernize R and enable an efficient workflow.  This tidy framework is great for learning while being productive.

## Load library Packages:  

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

&nbsp; 

> Note:  You must install a library-package before you load a library-package.  The above code chunk engages the `library()` function to load the "*tidyverse*" packages.  ([Video Help: Install Pages](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/00-setup/#section-install-packages))

As you see from the image above, the *tidyverse* package is a super-package consisting of several more precise and focused packages.  You can install packages from the **Tools** menu-bar in the RStudio IDE.

## Load Custom Data

Outside of this workshop, you'll likely want to load your own data.  R and RStudio support many methods of gathering and importing data.  Two common data import methods include importing data from the local file system or via a URL.  

RStudio has an on-board data loading wizard which leverages the `readr()` package for data loading.  There are several ways to engage this import function:

- `File > Import Dataset`
- Or, via the *Import Dataset* "button" found in the *Environment* Pane.

<figure>![RStudio Environment Pane](images/import_data.png "Environment Pane")<figcaption>RStudio Environment Pane</figcaption></figure><br>

Using the Import wizard, you can generate (and execute) the code necessary to read in the `cars.csv` file.

```{r load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# readr::read_csv
# 'read_csv()' is part of the tidyverse 'readr' package.  

cars <- read_csv("data/cars.csv")
```

'reader::read_csv()' helpfully overrides default behavior of the "base R" `read.csv()` function.  For example `read_csv()` does not automatically convert strings as factors.  You can read more about `readr`  http://readr.tidyverse.org/

## Workshop Data Set

During this workshop demonstration, We'll use the *Starwars* characters dataset, `starwars`. The data, part of the `dplyr` package, come from SWAPI, the Star Wars API, http://swapi.co/. Since the data are integrated into `dplyr`, we don't need to load the data, but you may still want to find information about the dataset.  The codebood for the Starwars dataset is integrated into the `dplyr` documentation.  To view the *Starwars* codebook, first load the `library(dplyr)` package.  Then, via the *Help* pane, search *starwars*.  Alternatively, in the *Console* pane, type `?starwars`.

Note:  `dplyr` is part of `tidyverse` which we loaded with the command:  `library(tidyverse)`

In the next module, Data Wrangling, we'll discus the `dplyr` package in greater detail.


## View your data in a grid.

```{r echo=TRUE}
starwars
```

### Other Data Loaders, a selective list

- `View()` is an exploratory convenience while using RStudio.  `View()` will not generate output in your [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) reports, but one advantage to `View()` is an on-board, clickable, sortable data-viewer used while computing within RStudio.

- The **Environment** Pane within RStudio presents information about data objects


## Modern Data Frames: Tibbles

A tibble (tbl) is a "Table as data frame", a modern tidyverse table.

```{r Table-dataframe}
class(starwars) 
starwars
```

&nbsp;

## Data Structure

### Most Common Data Structures

- Vector
- Data Frame & Tibble
- List
- Matrix

Read more about it in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html)

### Glimpse into a data frame

First, let's glimpse into a Tibble.  How do you know the object is a Tibble?  Read below about `class()`, but first ...

`glimpse()` reveals the structure of an object

```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```

The old-school way to `glimpse` into the structure is via the `str()` function.  It's fine but not as pretty as `glimpse()`.  Sometimes it's necessary to `str()`, particularly when investigating the structure of lists -- but that's way beyond what we're talking about here.

``` r
str(starwars)  #example, not executed. Practice this in your RStudio console or R Notebook.  
```

&nbsp;

## Data Type

### Most Common Data Types

- character
- numeric

    - integer (e.g. `30L`, `as.integer(30)`)
    - double (approximation with floating points and multiple special values)
    
- logical (True or False)
- factor (`[forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)` is especially used for for manipulating factor data)

### Class

`class()` identifies the class of an object revealing the data structure or the data type.

```{r}
class(starwars)
```

You can reference a vector within a dataframe via the `$<<column_name>>` syntax.

```{r}
class(starwars$name)
class(starwars$height)  
class(starwars$mass)
```


## Other Useful Functions

`tbl_vars` lists table variables (column headers) as a vector

```{r variables}
tbl_vars(starwars)
```
