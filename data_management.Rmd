Let's focus on the Tidyverse.  Tidyverse is a set of packages that work together within a common tidy-data framework.^[https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/]  These packages modernize R and enable an efficient workflow.  Although this method is not the only way to use R, you may work for a long time before you need to explore beyond the tidyverse.  This tidy framework is great for learning R and being productive when using R.  Let's get started.

## Load library Packages:  

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

&nbsp; 

> Note.  You must install a library-package before you load a library-package.  The above code chunk engages the `library()` function to load the "*tidyverse*" packages.  

As you see from the image above, the *tidyverse* package is a super-package consisting of several more precise and focused packages.  You can install packages from the **Tools** menu-bar in the RStudio IDE.

## Load Custom Data

Outside of this workshop, you'll likely want to load your own data.  R and RStudio support many methods of gathering and importing data.  Two common data import methods include importing data from the local file system or via a URL.  

RStudio has an on-board data loading wizard which leverages the `readr()` package for data loading.  There are several ways to engage this import function:

- `File > Import Dataset`
- Or, via the *Import Dataset* "button" found in the *Environment* Pane.

<figure>![RStudio Environment Pane](images/import_data.png "Environment Pane")<figcaption>RStudio Environment Pane</figcaption></figure><br>

Using the Import wizard, you can generate (and execute) the code necessary to read in the `cars.csv` file.

```{r load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# readr::read_csv
# 'read_csv()' is part of the tidyverse 'readr' package.  

cars <- read_csv("data/cars.csv")
```

'reader::read_csv()' helpfully overrides default behavior of the "base R" `read.csv()` function.  For example `read_csv()` does not automatically convert strings as factors.  You can read more about `readr`  http://readr.tidyverse.org/

## Workshop Data Set

During this workshop demonstration, We'll use the *Starwars* characters dataset, `starwars`. The data, part of the `dplyr` package, come from SWAPI, the Star Wars API, http://swapi.co/. Since the data are integrated into `dplyr`, we don't need to load the data, but you may still want to find information about the dataset.  The codebood for the Starwars dataset is integrated into the `dplyr` documentation.  To view the *Starwars* codebook, first load the `library(dplyr)` package.  Then, via the *Help* pane, search *starwars*.  Alternatively, in the *Console* pane, type `?starwars`.

Note:  `dplyr` is part of `tidyverse` which we loaded already.

In the next module, Data Wrangling, we'll discus the `dplyr` package in greater detail.


## View your data in a grid.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
View(starwars)
# Displays as a tab in the source-pane quadrant
# Does not dipsplay in an R Notebooks
```

### Other Data Loaders, a selective list

- `View()` is an exploratory convenience; it's not "reproducible" in the sense of generating a report or leaving a trail of your work.  One of the advantages is on-board clickable sorting

- Environment Pane has information about data objects


## Modern Data Frames: Tibbles

A tibble (tbl) is a "Table as data frame", a modern tidyverse table.

```{r Table-dataframe}
class(starwars) 
starwars
```

&nbsp;

## Data Structure

### Most Common Data Structures

- Vector
- Data Frame
- Tibble
- List
- Matrix

### Class

`class()` identifies the class of an object revealing the data structure or the data type.

```{r}
class(starwars)
```

### Glimpse into a data frame

`glimpse()` reveals the structure of an object

```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```

&nbsp;

## Data Type

### Most Common Data Types

- character
- numeric

    - integer (e.g. `30L`, `as.integer(30)`)
    - double (approximation with floating points and multiple special values)
    
- logical (True or False)
- factor

### Class

```{r}
class(starwars$name)
class(starwars$height)
class(starwars$mass)
```


## Other Useful Functions

`tbl_vars` lists table variables (column headers) as a vector

```{r variables}
tbl_vars(starwars)
```

&nbsp;

### Older style 

`str()` identifies the data structure:  data frames, matrices, lists, etc.

```{r}
str(starwars)
```
