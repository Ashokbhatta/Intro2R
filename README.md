# README

This repository contains supporting datasets and files for our **Intro to R** workshop by the [Duke Data & Visualization Services Department](http://library.duke.edu/data).  You can find more information about our future and past [workshops](http://library.duke.edu/data/news) 

## Project Update:
* Now using library(tidyverse) and ignoring base-r
* Now using library(ggvis) instead of library(ggplot2) -- because of the magrittr consistency
