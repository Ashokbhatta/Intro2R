The following learning materials support our *Introduction to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures* workshop.  Hosted by [Data & Visualization Services](http://library.duke.edu/) at Duke University Libraries, this is the first part of a muli-part learning series on R that we call [*R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*](https://rfun.library.duke.edu).  See also this [video recording](http://library.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=be91b9f6-f891-4fa4-9151-560c8dc32c18) of a previous workshop.

This gentle introduction provides a hands-on experience to learn the basics of modern R using RStudio and the Tidyverse method.  Learn about managing your R projects, data types, variable assignments, data structures, and visualization packages such as `ggvis` and `leaflet`.  The focus of these learning resources is as a code demonstration companion supporting our in-person workshop.  Thus the explaatory prose is minimal.  If you wish to read more about R, we recommend R4DS and Kieran, or the interactive course made available at DataCamp.  In fact, Attendees will be registered for the opportunity of supplementing this workshop with free academic access to [DataCamp's Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course.
