The following learning materials support our *Introduction to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures* workshop.  Hosted by [Data & Visualization Services](http://library.duke.edu/) at Duke University Libraries, this is the first part of a multi-part learning series on R that we call [*R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*](https://rfun.library.duke.edu).  See also this [video recording](https://library.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=651c273a-f1b0-485b-bf47-6bd61e304020) of a previous workshop.

This gentle introduction provides a hands-on experience to learn the basics of modern R using RStudio and the Tidyverse method.  Learn about managing your R projects, data types, variable assignments, data structures, and visualization packages such as `ggvis` and `leaflet`.  The focus of these learning resources is as a code demonstrations supporting our in-person workshop.  Thus the explanatory prose is minimal.  If you wish to read more about R, we recommend [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [Data Visualization for Social Science](http://socviz.co/), or the interactive course made available at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Attendees will be registered for the opportunity of supplementing this workshop with free academic access to [DataCamp's Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course.
