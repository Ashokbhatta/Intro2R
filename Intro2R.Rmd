## Data Management

Let's focus on the Tidyverse.  Tidyverse is a set of packages that work together within a common tidy-data framework.^[https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/]  These packages modernize R and enable an efficient workflow.  Although this method is not the only way to use R, you may work for a long time before you need to explore beyond the tidyverse.  This tidy framework is great for learning R and being productive when using R.  Let's get started.

Load the library:  

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasets)
```

### Data Set

- We'll use a derivative of the `mtcars` dataset.  
- Use the `?mtcars` to get the codebook.

### Load Data

RStudio has an on-board data loading wizard which uses the `readr()` package for data loading.  
See Menubar `File > Import Dataset`

```{r getdata1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# readr::read_csv
# 'read_csv()' is part of the 'readr' package and will override the base-R default of converting characters as factors.  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/README.html

cars <- read_csv("data/cars.csv")
```



```{r getdata2}
cars <- as_tibble(rownames_to_column(mtcars, var = "makeModel"))
```

### View your data in a grid

```{r randmonName}
#View(cars)
# Displays as a tab in the source-pane quadrant
# Does not dipsplay in an R Notebooks
```

### Other Data Loaders, a selective list

- `View()` is an exploratory convenience; it's not "reproducible" in the sense of generating a report or leaving a trail of your work.  One of the advantages is on-board clickable sorting

- Environment Pane has information about data objects


### Tibbles: Modern Data Frames

A tible (tbl) is a "Table as data frame", a modern tidyverse table.

```{r Table-dataframe}
cars 
```



## Data Structure

### Most Common Data Structures

- Vector
- Data Frame
- Tibble
- List
- Matrix

### Class

`class()` identifies the class of an object revealing the data structure or the data type.

```{r}
class(cars)
```

### Glimpse into a data frame

`glimpse()` reveals the structure of an object

```{r}
glimpse(cars)
```



## Data Type

### Most Common Data Types

- character
- numeric

    - integer (e.g. `30L`, `as.integer(30)`)
    - double (approximation with floating points and multiple special values)
    
- logical (True or False)
- factor

### Class

```{r}
class(cars$makeModel)
class(cars$mpg)


```


## Other Useful Functions

`tbl_vars` lists table variables (column headers) as a vector

```{r variables}
tbl_vars(cars)
```



### str():   

`str()` identifies the data structure:  data frames, matrices, lists, etc.

```{r}
str(cars)
```


## Data Wrangling with Dplyr

### Arrange

**Arrange** to sort rows (observations) by column headers (variables)

```{r arrange, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cars %>% 
  arrange(cyl, desc(mpg), desc(hp))
```

### Select

**Select** to choose columns (variables)

```{r select}
cars %>% 
    arrange(cyl, desc(mpg), desc(hp)) %>% 
    select(makeModel, cyl, mpg, hp)
```


### Filter

**Filter** to select rows (observations)

```{r filter}
sixcyls <- cars %>% 
  filter(cyl == 6)

sixcyls    # display filtered data frame
```

### Mutate

**Mutate** to create new variables (columns) 

```{r mutate}
sixcyls %>% 
  mutate(dispWt = disp / wt) %>% 
  select(makeModel, cyl, mpg, hp, dispWt)
```

### Count

**Count** to summarize observations (rows)

```{r count}
sixcyls %>% 
  count(hp)
```

Note:  `count()` is not part of the five dplyr verbs.  It's often used with `summarize` and included for it's the brevity of functionality.  The example below will demonstrate the flexibility of the `summarize()` function which is a dplyr verb.

### Summarize
Summarize to collapse values into a summary

```{r}
sixcyls %>% 
  group_by(hp) %>% 
  summarize(Count = n(), mean_wt = mean(wt), min_wt = min(wt), max_wt = max(wt))
```


## Put it all together

We can pipe commands together.  Think of a pipe (i.e. `%>%`) as a conjunction.  Any time you see a pipe, think "and then."  You can insert a pipe with 'Ctrl+Shift+M' (Help > Keyboard Shortcts)

```{r alltogether}

cars %>% 
  filter(cyl >= 4, cyl <= 6) %>% 
  select(makeModel, mpg:wt) %>%
  mutate(dispWt = disp / wt) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mpg), wt)
```
