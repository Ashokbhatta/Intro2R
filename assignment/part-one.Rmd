## Loading Data

*Load the file into a new variable called `westUnion`?*

Hints:

- The data are in a a csv file on your local workstation but need to be loaded into R.  The data file is in a directory relative to your Rmd script: `data/westUnion.csv`.

- One option is to use the *Import Dataset* feature of RStudio. The code will be generated for you, which you can run immediately.  Or, look to the bottom of the dialogue box and capture the code to run in your R script.

    - insert image: images/import_data.png

Write the R code required to load csv data:

```{r read_csv, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r read_csv-solution}
westUnion <- read_csv("data/westUnion.csv")
# Note...  Your code will not run in this tutorial window
# Use an R Notebook to practice exercise one.
```


## Data Type

```{r datatype}
quiz(
  question("What function will tell you the data type for westUnion?",
    answer("glimpse(westUnion)"),
    answer("tbl_vars(westUnion)"),
    answer("class(westUnion)", correct = TRUE),
    answer("str(westUnion)")
  ),
  question("The data type for westUnion is?",
    answer("Data Frame", message = "A modern data frame is known as a Tibble"),
    answer("List"),
    answer("Character"),
    answer("Tibble", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Matrix")
  )
)
```


## Data Structure

Take a look at the structure of the `westUnion` variable.

```{r dataStructure}
quiz(
    question("What is the best command to concisely learn more about 
             the variables, observations, and data types 
             within a Tibble",
             answer("class(westUnion)"),
             answer("glimpse(westUnion)", correct = TRUE),
             answer("tbl_vars(westUnion)"),
             answer("str(westUnion)", message = "This works but is 
                    not a conscise report"),
             answer("westUnion", message = "This will work but 
                    require a lot of mouse-clicking on your part")
           ),
  question("How many observations (rows) are there?",
           answer("59", correct = TRUE),
           answer("4, 4, 6, 8, 7, 8, 9, 4,..."),
           answer("7"),
           answer("None of the Above")
           ),
  question("How many variables (columns) are there?",
           answer("59"),
           answer("4 4 6 8 7 8 9 4 9 9 ..."),
           answer("7", correct = TRUE),
           answer("All of the above")
           ),
  question("How many of the variables are numeric data?",
           answer("59"),
           answer("7"),
           answer("5"),
           answer("2", correct = TRUE)
           )
  )
```
